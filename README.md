## Welcome

This application is for automatically landmarking photos of threespine stickleback for the Stuart Lab at Loyola University Chicago using simple-ml-morph from the github user agporto. It includes features for formatting ObjectJ landmarks for MLmorph, predicting landmark locations using a pre-trained model, and calculating feature lengths from the resulting landmarks.
